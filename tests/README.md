# Tests

This directory contains test cases for the GTS specification operations. The test cases are implemented using Pytest and are designed to run against any web server implementing the GTS operations API.

## Architecture Rationale

### Why Tests Live in the Specification Repository

The tests are intentionally kept **alongside the specification** rather than in individual language implementations for several critical reasons:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The specification defines the contract that all implementations must satisfy. By keeping tests here, we ensure that all language implementations (Python, Go, Rust, etc.) are validated against the exact same behavioral requirements.

2. **Implementation Independence**: Tests are written as black-box HTTP API tests, making them completely language-agnostic. Any implementation that exposes the required HTTP endpoints can be validated, regardless of the underlying technology stack.

3. **Specification Evolution**: When the GTS specification evolves, the tests evolve in lockstep. This prevents drift between what the spec defines and what implementations are tested against.

4. **Cross-Implementation Consistency**: All implementations must pass the same test suite, guaranteeing behavioral consistency across Python, Go, Rust, and future language bindings.

5. **Easier Onboarding**: New implementation authors can immediately validate their work against the canonical test suite without having to interpret or reimplement test logic.

### Why Implementations Are Separate

While tests live with the specification, the actual server implementations are maintained in separate repositories:

- [gts-python](https://github.com/globaltypesystem/gts-python) - Python implementation
- [gts-go](https://github.com/globaltypesystem/gts-go) - Go implementation
- [gts-rust](https://github.com/globaltypesystem/gts-rust) - Rust implementation

**Reasons for separation:**

1. **Language-Specific Tooling**: Each language has its own dependency management, build systems, and development workflows (pip/poetry for Python, go modules, cargo for Rust).

2. **Independent Release Cycles**: Implementations can release bug fixes, performance improvements, and language-specific features without requiring specification changes.

3. **Community Ownership**: Different teams or maintainers can own different language implementations while all adhering to the same specification.

4. **Reduced Coupling**: Separating implementations prevents language-specific concerns from polluting the specification repository.

### Testing Approach

The test suite validates implementations through a standardized HTTP API. Each implementation must:

- Expose endpoints defined in [openapi.json](openapi.json)
- Run on port 8000 (configurable via `GTS_BASE_URL`)
- Implement all required GTS operations (ID validation, parsing, schema validation, etc.)

This approach provides:
- **Technology neutrality**: Tests use only HTTP and JSON, no language-specific dependencies
- **Portability**: Tests can run in any environment with Python and network access
- **Simplicity**: No complex test harnesses or language interop required

## Running the tests

```bash
# Start your server on 8000 port
<your-server-start-command>

# Run all the tests
pytest .

# Run a specific test case group
pytest op1_id_validation_test.py

# override server URL using GTS_BASE_URL environment variable
GTS_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001 pytest

# or set it persistently
export GTS_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8001
pytest
```

```

## Implemented test cases

- [x] **OP#1 - ID Validation**: Verify identifier syntax using regex patterns
- [x] **OP#2 - ID Extraction**: Fetch identifiers from JSON objects or JSON Schema documents
- [x] **OP#3 - ID Parsing**: Decompose identifiers into constituent parts (vendor, package, namespace, type, version, etc.)
- [x] **OP#4 - ID Pattern Matching**: Match identifiers against patterns containing wildcards
- [x] **OP#5 - ID to UUID Mapping**: Generate deterministic UUIDs from GTS identifiers
- [x] **OP#6 - Schema Validation**: Validate object instances against their corresponding schemas
- [x] **OP#7 - Relationship Resolution**: Load all schemas and instances, resolve inter-dependencies, and detect broken references
- [x] **OP#8 - Compatibility Checking**: Verify that schemas with different MINOR versions are compatible
- [x] **OP#8.1 - Backward compatibility checking**
- [x] **OP#8.2 - Forward compatibility checking**
- [x] **OP#8.3 - Full compatibility checking**
- [x] **OP#9 - Version Casting**: Transform instances between compatible MINOR versions
- [x] **OP#10 - Query Execution**: Filter identifier collections using the GTS query language
- [x] **OP#11 - Attribute Access**: Retrieve property values and metadata using the attribute selector (`@`)
